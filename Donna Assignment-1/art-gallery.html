<!---"WCAG" reseach 
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines cover the information in a website including: text, images, forms, and other media. 

Version 2.0 is incorporated by reference into other standards, primarily at government level. Version 2.0 builds on this with 17 further success criteria; including mobile interfaces, supporting cognitive impairments, responsive design and supporting users with low vision.

The guidelines are structured around four main ideas: Being Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust.
 
Perceivable: Users must be able to perceive the information and user interface components that are presented to them.    It cannot be invisible to all of their sense.

Operable: User interface components and navigation must be operable and user-friendly. The interface should not require users to perform any actions that are difficult to understand or complete.

Understandable: The user interface must be easy to understand and the content or operation of it must not exceed their understanding.  
 
Robust: Content must be clear and detailed enough that it can be accurately understood by many different user agents, including assistive technologies.As technology and web browsers improve, the content should still be accessible.

Each of these four principles has a corresponding set of guidelines. 

There are 12 in total for WCAG 2.0 and 13 in total for WCAG 2.1, including text alternatives, time-based media, adaptable, distinguishable, keyboard accessible, enough time, seizures, navigable, input modalities, readable, predictable, input assistance and compatibility. 

Each guideline has success criteria which address important access issues that specifically impact people with disabilities.
